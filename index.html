The Bible say "The wages of sin is death"

No matter who we are, the common truth relating everyone of us is that none of us is perfect.
All have sinned and come short of the glory of God says the Bible.The actual fact is that none of us can ever say we have never sinned in our life.In this context every one of us are worthy of the punishment of sin ,that is death which is being eternally seperated from God in hell fire.

The only way for man to be saved from the impending punishment was that someone with no sin and hence having no need to be punished should come forward to take the sins of man upon himself willingly and be punished in his place so that he might be made free from his sins and escape the punishment thereoff which is Hell fire.

God in this place because of His matchless love toward you and me came forward to give his only son Jesus Christ who did no sin, for us so that He might be punished in our place for our sins. Jesus Christ was born as a man 2021 years back and lived a perfect life without doing any sin. But because of His love toward you and me He took our sins upon himself willingly and was punished for our sins. He was crusified on the cross and died for our sins. He rose up on the third day alive even as He said and is ther to help you out.
<img class="mySlides" src="Jesus_tomb-Jerusalem.jpg" width="60%" height="40%">
      </br><center><i>Open tomb of Jesus at Jerusalem</i></center>
And now when we believe this goodnews that Jesus was punished in our place for our sins and come to Him, that is ask Him to forgive our sins turning from our sinful life, He is completely willing to forgive our sins and give us peace and joy on earth and also the gift of eternal life(living with Him forever in heaven) as He says,
      <center><h2>"</h2><i>The one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out-JESUS</i><h2>"</h2></br>(from BIBLE)</center>

Just take a minute and say to Him from where you are that were sorry for your sins, from your heart and ask Him to forgive you. Even when you do this truly beleiving in Him He will surely forgive you and help live without doing sin and you will be able to fell true joy and peace in your heart and the confidence that you will go to heaven after your life on earth.        
 <center><h2>"</h2><i>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</i><h2>"</h2></br>(from Bible)</center>
