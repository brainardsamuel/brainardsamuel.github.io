  Hello and welcome, as the year 2020 ends and a new year begins there may arise a lot of doubts in your minds apart from the usual level of happines which preceds each new year. There may be fears revolving in our minds tending to ask "will this year too be a year of trouble and problems as the last year was??" or will this make a new and hopefull start in my life.

  We all would have definitely heard about king Solomon who was very well known for his wisdom. The history speaks of his father King David who regned the country of Israel for a long period. Of no doubt as a king he would have had a lot of problems which he had to face. But the David testifies in the Bible "I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears." This tesimony reveals us the good news that seeking God for help would definitely solve our problems.

  But there may arise a small doubt in our heart as to how we can approach the invisible God for help?? The simplest answer stands here.

  The Bible says "But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear." So breaking the barrier of our sins is the only way we could approach God. But who is the man that can solve the barrier of sin for us and take us close to God that we may request His help, for the Bible says "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" and there is no man perfect so that he may take us close to God.

  So God on the other side taking pity of our helpless state sent His own dear Son "JESUS CHRIST" into the world so that He might take the punishment of our sins upon Himself and grant us access to God as the Bible tells "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him". He who was without sin and needed not to be punished, took our sins upon Himelf and was punished instead of us, that we may be delivered from our sins and might be granted access to God.

  Now the only thing that we have to do is to accept and believe that Christ Jesus did everything for us taking the penalty of our sins upon Himelf and just beliving Him and accepting Him into your life solves your barrier of sin and provides you access into the presence of God as the Bible says "no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned."
 
  Thus beleiving this, if you confess your sins to Jesus Christ just from the place where you are now, and accept His forgivness which He grants you by paying the penalty of sins, even death by dying for you on the cross you can even now enjoy the true happiness of forgiveness, which is even the removal of the barrier of sins which seperates us from God.

  And from now on, God becomes your father and as you seek Him for help, He will now deliver you from from all your fears and you too can enjoy the brand new life that He offers and also live with Him in heaven for evermore escaping the damnation of hell and live with Him in fulness of joy.
